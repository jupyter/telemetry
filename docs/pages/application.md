# Adding telemetry to an application

Jupyter Telemetry enables you to log events from your running application. (It's designed to work best with traitlet's `Application` object for simple configuration.) To use telemetry, begin by creating an instance of `EventLog`:

```python
from jupyter_telemetry import EventLog

class MyApplication:

    def __init__(self):
        ...
        # The arguments
        self.eventlog = EventLog(
            ...
            # Either pass the traits (see below) here,
            # or enable users of your application to configure
            # the EventLog's traits.
        )
```

EventLog has two configurable traits:

    - `handlers`: a list of Python's logging handlers that handle the recording of incoming events.
    - `allowed_schemas`: a dictionary of options for each schema describing what data should be collected.

Next, you'll need to register event schemas for your application. You can register schemas using the `register_schema_file` (JSON or YAML format) or `register_schema` methods.


Once your have an instance of `EventLog` and your registered schemas, you can use the `record_event` method to log that event.


```python
# Record an example event.
event = {'name': 'example event'}
self.eventlog.record_event(
    schema_id='url.to.event.schema',
    version=1,
    event=event
)
```
