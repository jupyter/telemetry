# Writing a schema for telemetry

All Schemas should be a valid [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) and can be written in valid YAML or JSON.

At a minimum, valid Jupyter Telemetry Event schema requires have the following keys:

- `$id` : a URI to identify (and possibly locate) the schema.
- `version` : schema version.
- `title` : name of the schema
- `description` : documentation for the schema
- `properties` : attributes of the event being emitted.

    Each property should have the following attributes:

    + `title` : name of the property
    + `description`: documentation for this property.
    + `categories`: list of types of data being collected

- `required`: list of required properties.

Here is a minimal example of a valid JSON schema for an event.

```yaml
$id: event.jupyter.org/example-event
version: 1
title: My Event
description: |
  All events must have a name property
type: object
properties:
  thing:
    title: Thing
    categories:
      - category.jupyter.org/unrestricted
    description: A random thing.
  user:
    title: User name
    categories:
      - category.jupyter.org/user-identifier
    description: Name of user who initiated event
required:
- thing
- user
```



# Property Categories

Each property can be labelled with `categories` field. This makes it easier to filter properties based on a category. We recommend that schema authors use valid URIs for these labels, e.g. something like `category.jupyter.org/unrestricted`.

Below is a list of common category labels that Jupyter Telemetry recommends using:

* `category.jupyter.org/unrestricted`
* `category.jupyter.org/user-identifier`
* `category.jupyter.org/user-identifiable-information`
* `category.jupyter.org/action-timestamp`
